As someone who has spent most of my life behind a computer, I got used to my operating system to the point where I stopped questioning it. I didn’t look for better options. I simply adapted.

Like many developers, I once saw macOS as the “ideal” setup: powerful, polished, and expensive. Always interesting, but always out of reach.

Everything changed when I realized the best development environment I’ve ever used is free, open source, and entirely under my control.

But that kind of simplicity, the kind that removes abstractions instead of adding them, comes with something many developers are not comfortable with: **responsibility**.  

There’s a phrase I really like: _“standing on the shoulders of giants.”_ It means that progress is built on the knowledge of those who came before us, allowing us to see further. As a software developer, I’m constantly chasing the work of better engineers, looking for small pieces of knowledge that can move me one step forward.

So far, the biggest “small step” I’ve taken was giving Linux the attention it deserved.

**Growing Up With Windows**

I started using computers when I was eight. A relative had a machine with dial‑up internet, and every time we visited, all I could think about was using it. From that early experience to the PC I built with my own money years later, and every computer in between, I always used Windows. I never stopped to ask _why_.

When you grow up clicking buttons and feeling uncomfortable when a terminal window appears, tasks like mounting disks, managing services, dealing with permissions, or editing configuration files feel intimidating.

So the idea of using an operating system that boots directly into a terminal, with no GUI unless you install one yourself, no audio drivers unless you install one yourself, is terrifying for many people.

**Arch Linux’s Philosophy**

Arch has a philosophy that differs from most mainstream distributions. The documentation describes it as a **pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one**, where _“evidence‑based technical analysis and debate are what matter, not politics or popular opinion.”_

Arch is **user‑centric, not user‑friendly**. And there’s a big difference.

It’s designed to meet the needs of its contributors, not to attract the largest number of users. The documentation states clearly:

> _“It is targeted at the proficient GNU/Linux user, or anyone with a do‑it‑yourself attitude who is willing to read the documentation and solve their own problems.”_

If you know me, you know I agree with that philosophy 200%.

**Versatility and Control**

One of the reasons I decided to stick with Arch instead of any other distro is simple:  
**Once you understand Arch, you don’t need another operating system — probably ever.**

Both my personal computer and my home server run Arch smoothly. The system gives you the ability to **build a custom environment** by choosing from thousands of high‑quality packages in the official repositories.

And then there’s the AUR, the Arch User Repository.

When I started using Arch, I didn’t fully understand its power. And then I realized:  
**the AUR offers almost everything.**

With tools like `yay`, you can install packages maintained by the community, often faster and more up‑to‑date than official software. Many official packages actually _started_ as AUR packages.

If you're passionate about **open source**, the AUR is one of the best examples of what a community can build: a repository created **by Arch users, for Arch users**. And that's honestly one of the coolest things I’ve seen in the Linux community.

**Final Thoughts**

Arch Linux scares people not because it’s complicated (maybe a little bit), but the freedom adn **control** come with a price, are you willing to pay? 
Once you do, it becomes one of the most powerful tools you can use as a developer.
